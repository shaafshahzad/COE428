SUMMARY:
Both requirements for this lab were met and everything compiles with no issues.
towers contains the recursive algorithm for moving disks. It also tracks recursion depth and the move sequence.
towersMain contains the command line argument handling allowing for n/from/dest to be specified or defaulted.

QUESTION 1 - 'Suppose that towers(5, 2, 3) is invoked':
(a) The first recursive call to towers() will be invoked as 'towers(4, 2, 1)'.
(b) It will take five recursive calls to reach the initial invocation.
(c) 'Move #1: From Tower 2 to Tower 3' will be printed out.
(d) The second recursive call to towers() will be invoked as 'towers(0, 1, 3)'.

QUESTION 2 - 'Suppose that towers(8, 1, 2) is invoked. How many lines will be printed to stdout?': 
When towers(8, 1, 2) is invoked, 255 lines will be printed to stdout.
